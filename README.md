# Robotic-Delivery-Algorithm

-	Designed an optimized algorithm for robotic delivery of food parcels using Python in a team of two members. 
-	Solved the problem by using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the concept of Dynamic Programming, DFS, and Disjoint Sets.
-	Analyzed the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.
